      <h3>Our Origin</h3>
      <p>A popular weekend activity when I was in campus was cycling where you could provide you ID and pay up then
        get
        a bicycle for the entire day. After finishing campus and moving away from the school for work I realised how
        difficult it was to find a one-stop shop where you could rent any bike that was both efficient and reliable.
        In
        most cases the best shot was to go directly to the shop which was an option due to the added hustle of
        transporting the bike to where I lived.</p>
      <br />
      <p>As such, I decided to come up with a platform through which you could easily rent a bike and have it
        delivered
        be it to your home, office, school or just below your hiking trail.</p>
      <p>I hope that the platform encourages more people to choose cycling which is both good for your health and for
        the environment. Cycling is flexible and cheap compared to alternative transport means.</p>
